# Calls-Data-Capstone-project

## Overview
This Python Pandas project focuses on analyzing 911 call data sourced from Kaggle. The dataset comprises essential fields providing information about emergency calls, including geographical coordinates, call description, zipcode, call title, timestamp, township, address, and a dummy variable.

## Dataset Fields
- **lat:** String variable representing Latitude.
- **lng:** String variable representing Longitude.
- **desc:** String variable providing a description of the Emergency Call.
- **zip:** String variable indicating the Zipcode.
- **title:** String variable denoting the Title of the emergency call.
- **timeStamp:** String variable showing the timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
- **twp:** String variable specifying the Township.
- **addr:** String variable representing the Address.
- **e:** String variable acting as a dummy variable, consistently set to 1.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this capstone project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The EDA will unveil insights and patterns within the 911 call data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the emergency incidents recorded.

## Analysis Tools
1. **Pandas:** Utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration.
2. **Matplotlib:** Employed for creating visualizations such as plots and charts.
3. **Seaborn:** Used to enhance the aesthetics and informativeness of the visualizations.

## Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Load the 911 call dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure of the dataset, check for missing values, and gain insights into the distribution of key variables.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handle any missing or inconsistent data to ensure the dataset's integrity.
4. **Visualizations:** Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations, unveiling patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.
5. **Insights:** Draw meaningful conclusions from the visualizations, addressing key questions related to emergency incidents.

## Conclusion
This 911 Calls Capstone Project aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the emergency call data, shedding light on the geographical, temporal, and categorical aspects of the incidents. The combination of Python Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn will be instrumental in extracting valuable insights from the dataset.
